# Instructions  
## Mastermind
- Generate a random four digit number.
- The player has to keep inputting four digit numbers
  until they guess the randomly generated number.
- After each unsuccessful try it should say 
how many numbers they got correct,
but not which position they got right.
- At the end of the game should congratulate the user and say how many tries it took.
## Extensions: 
1. Let the user pick an easy mode which shows the user which position that they guessed correctly
2. Let the user pick a hard mode that gives five digits instead of four
3. After the game is finished, ask the user for their name and input their score into a table. Show them the high score at the start of the game so that it gives a sense of competition.
